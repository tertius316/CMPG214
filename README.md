CMPG214 Assignment 1
Creating ME

I am Tertius Victor proud 43 year old NWU IT student with student number 12630888 (yes I have been at NWU for long)

Business owner, father to 2 young boys and husband to a lovely wife

This assingment is a visual representation of Tertius Victor the IT specialist and was fun and creative to do and yes it will stick.
The logo with the TV shielded is what I am - ME, strong and safe represented by the shield.
This has changed the way I see me as a product and inventor
